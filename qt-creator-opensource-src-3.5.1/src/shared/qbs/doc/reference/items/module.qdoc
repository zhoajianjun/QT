    \title Module Item
    \brief Represents a collection of properties and items that can be loaded into a product.

    A \c Module item is a collection of properties and language items that are used for building a
    product if the product has a \l{Depends Item}{dependency} on the module.
    The following (somewhat artificial) module pre-processes text files by removing certain
    characters from them:

    \code
    import qbs
    import qbs.FileInfo
    import qbs.TextFile

    Module {
        property stringList unwantedCharacters: []
        FileTagger {
            patterns: ["*.raw"]
            fileTags: ["raw-txt"]
        }
        Rule {
            inputs: ["raw-txt"]
            Artifact {
                filePath: FileInfo.relativePath(input.filePath, product.sourceDirectory) +
                           "/" + input.fileName + ".processed"
                fileTags: ["processed-txt"]
            }
            prepare: {
                var cmd = new JavaScriptCommand();
                cmd.description = "Processing " + input.fileName;
                cmd.sourceCode = function() {
                    var inFile = new TextFile(input.filePath, TextFile.ReadOnly);
                    var content = inFile.readAll();
                    inFile.close();
                    var unwantedChars = product.moduleProperty("txt_processor",
                                                               "unwantedCharacters");
                    for (var c in unwantedChars)
                        content = content.replace(unwantedChars[c], "");
                    var outFile = new TextFile(output.filePath, TextFile.WriteOnly);
                    outFile.write(content);
                    outFile.close();
                };
                return cmd;
            }
        }
    }
    \endcode

    And this is how a product would use the module:

    \code
    Product {
        type: "processed-txt"
        Depends { name: "txt_processor" }
        txt_processor.unwantedCharacters: ["\r"]
        files: [
            "file1.raw",
            "file2.raw"
        ]
    }
    \endcode

    Of course, normally the pre-processed files would not be the target artifacts of the product,
    but rather serve as inputs to a different rule that will often come from a different module.

    How you make your own modules available to \QBS is explained
    \l{Custom Modules and Items}{here}.

    \section1 Special Property Values

    For every property defined in a module, \QBS provides the following special built-in values:
    \section2 \c base
    This value is useful when making use of inheritance. It stands for the value of the respective
    property in the item one level up in the inheritance chain. For instance:
    \code
    Product { // defined in MyProduct.qbs
        Depends { name: "mymodule" }
        mymodule.someProperty: ["value1"]
    }
    ------ some other file ------
    MyProduct {
        mymodule.someProperty: base.concat(["value2"]) // => ["value1", "value2"]
    }
    \endcode

    \section2 \c original
    This is the value of the property in the module itself (possibly overridden from a profile or
    the command line). Use it to set a module property conditionally:
    \code
    Module { // This is mymodule
        property string aProperty: "z"
    }
    ----------
    Product {
        Depends { name: "mymodule" }
        Depends { name: "myothermodule" }
        mymodule.aProperty: myothermodule.anotherProperty === "x" ? "y" : original // => "y" if myothermodule.anotherProperty is "x", "z" otherwise
    \endcode

    \section2 \c outer
    This value is used in nested items, where it refers to the value of the respective property
    in the surrounding item. It is often encountered in \l{Group Item}{groups}:
    \code
    Product {
        Depends { name: "mymodule" }
        mymodule.someProperty: ["value1"]
        Group {
            name: "special files"
            files: ["somefile1", "somefile2"]
            mymodule.someProperty: outer.concat(["value"]) // => ["value1", "value2"]
        }
    }
    \endcode


    \section1 Module Properties

    \table
        \header
            \li Property
            \li Type
            \li Default
            \li Description
        \row
            \li additionalProductTypes
            \li string list
            \li empty list
            \li The elements of this list will be added to the \c type property of a product
                that has a dependency on the module.
        \row
            \li condition
            \li bool
            \li \c true
            \li Controls whether the module is enabled. If this property is \c false, the
                surrounding \c Module item will not be considered in the module look-up.
        \row
            \li present
            \li bool
            \li \c true
            \li This property is read-only. Its value is \c false if and only if the respective
                \c Depends item had its \c required property set to \c false and the module was
                not found.
        \row
            \li setupBuildEnvironment
            \li script
            \li \c undefined
            \li Script for setting up the environment in which the project is built.
            Use the \c putEnv, \c getEnv, and \c unsetEnv functions to alter the environment.
            The return value of this script is ignored.
        \row
            \li setupRunEnvironment
            \li script
            \li \c setupBuildEnvironment
            \li Script for setting up the environment in which the project is run.
        \row
            \li validate
            \li script
            \li \c undefined
            \li Script that is run after the module is loaded. It can be used to check property
            values and throw errors in unexpected cases. The return value is ignored.
