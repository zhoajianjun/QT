    \title SubProject Item
    \brief Adds a project from a different file.

    A \c SubProject item is used to add a project defined in another file as a sub-project to
    the surrounding project:
    \code
    SubProject {
        filePath: "subdir/project.qbs"
        Properties {
            name: "A sub-project"
        }
    }
    \endcode

    If you don't need to set any properties on the sub-project, you can also use the \c references
    property, the same way you would do for a product:
    \code
    references: "subdir/project.qbs"
    \endcode

    It is also possible to nest \c Project items directly in the same file.

            \li Property
            \li Type
            \li Default

        \row
            \li filePath
            \li path
            \li empty
            \li The file path of the project to add as a sub-project. If the top-level item in this
                file is a \c Product, it gets wrapped automatically in a new project.
        \row
            \li inheritProperties
            \li bool
            \li true
            \li Whether the sub-project should inherit the properties of the surrounding project.
                You can use this feature to share "global" settings between (sub-)projects.
