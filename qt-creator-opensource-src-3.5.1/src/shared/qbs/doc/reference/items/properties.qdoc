    \title Properties Item
    \brief Provides conditional setting of properties.

    \note This documents the \c Properties item in the context of products. Usage within
    a \c SubProject item is described \l{SubProject Item}{here}.

    The \c Properties item is an auxiliary item for setting multiple property values conditionally.

    In the following example, two properties are set if the project is built for Windows:
    \code
    Product {
        Properties {
            condition: qbs.targetOS.contains("windows")
            cpp.defines: ["ON_WINDOWS"]
            cpp.includePaths: ["extraWindowsIncludes"]
        }
    }
    \endcode

    Multiple \c Properties items can be specified to set properties dependent on different
    conditions. The order of appearance is important. Semantics are similar to if-else-chains.
    The following example
    \code
    Product {
        Properties {
            condition: qbs.targetOS.contains("windows")
            cpp.defines: ["ON_WINDOWS"]
            cpp.includePaths: ["myWindowsIncludes"]
        }
        Properties {
            condition: qbs.targetOS.contains("linux")
            cpp.defines: ["ON_LINUX"]
            cpp.includePaths: ["myLinuxIncludes"]
        }
        cpp.defines: ["ON_UNKNOWN_PLATFORM"]
    }
    \endcode
    is equivalent to
    \code
    Product {
        cpp.defines: {
            if (qbs.targetOS.contains("windows"))
                return ["ON_WINDOWS"];
            if (qbs.targetOS.contains("linux"))
                return ["ON_LINUX"];
            return ["ON_UNKNOWN_PLATFORM"];
        }
        cpp.includePaths: {
            if (qbs.targetOS.contains("windows"))
                return ["myWindowsIncludes"];
            if (qbs.targetOS.contains("linux"))
                return ["myLinuxIncludes"];
            return base;
        }
    }
    \endcode

    We suggest to use the \c Properties item for mutually exclusive conditions only. It is
    especially useful if there are several properties to set, based on the same condition.

    \table
        \header
            \li Property
            \li Type
            \li Default
            \li Description
        \row
            \li condition
            \li bool
            \li none - must be specified
            \li The condition to be used for the other bindings in this item.
    \endtable
