    \title Group Item
    \brief Groups files in a product.

    This item is attached to a product and used to group files that have something in common.
    For example:

     \code
     Application {
         Group {
             name: "common files"
             files: ["myclass.h", "myclass_common_impl.cpp"]
         }
         Group {
             name: "Windows files"
             condition: targetOS.contains("windows")
             files: "myclass_win_impl.cpp"
         }
         Group {
             name: "Linux files"
             condition: targetOS.contains("linux")
             files: "myclass_linux_impl.cpp"
         }
         Group {
             name: "Files to install"
             qbs.install: true
             qbs.installDir: "share"
             files: "runtime_resource.txt"
         }
     }
     \endcode
     When specifying files, you can use the wildcards "*", "?" and "[]", which have their usual meaning.
     By default, matching files are only picked up directly from the parent directory, but you can tell \QBS to
     consider the whole directory tree. It is also possible to exclude certain files from the list.
     The pattern ** used in a pathname expansion context will match all files and zero or more
     directories and subdirectories.
     For example:
     \snippet reference/items/group.qbs 0

     A group can also be used to attach properties to build artifacts such as executables or
     libraries. In the following example, an application is installed to "<install root>/bin".
     \code
     Application {
         Group {
             fileTagsFilter: "application"
             qbs.install: true
             qbs.installDir: "bin"
         }
     }
     \endcode

     Groups may also appear in modules, which causes the respective sources to be added to the
     products depending on said module.

    \section1 Group Properties

    \table
    \header
        \li Property
        \li Type
        \li Default
        \li Description
    \row
        \li name
        \li string
        \li "Group x", where x is a unique number among all the groups in the product
        \li The name of the group. Not used internally; mainly useful for IDEs.
    \row
        \li files
        \li list
        \li empty list
        \li The files in the group. Mutually exclusive with fileTagsFilter.
    \row
        \li prefix
        \li string
        \li empty string
        \li A string to prepend to all files. Slashes are allowed and have directory semantics.
    \row
        \li fileTagsFilter
        \li list
        \li empty list
        \li Artifact file tags to match. Any properties set in this group will be applied
            to the product's artifacts whose file tags intersect with the ones
            listed here. Mutually exclusive with files.
    \row
        \li condition
        \li bool
        \li true
        \li Determines whether the files in the group are actually considered part of the project.
    \row
        \li fileTags
        \li list
        \li empty list
        \li Tags to attach to the group's files. These can then be matched by a rule.
            Note that file taggers are never applied to a file that has this property set.
    \row
        \li overrideTags
        \li bool
        \li true
        \li Determines how tags on files that are listed both at the top level of
            a product and a group are handled.
            If this property is true, then the file tags set via the group
            replace the ones set via the product.
            If it is false, the "group tags" are added to the "product tags".
    \row
        \li excludeFiles
        \li list
        \li empty list
        \li For use with wildcards; the files in this list are "subtracted" from the files list.
    \endtable
