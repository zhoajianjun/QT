    \title Transformer Item
    \brief Creates files, typically from other files.

    A \e transformer takes zero or more inputs and produces one or more output artifacts
    from them. The following transformer creates one output file from one input file:
    \code
    Transformer {
        inputs: "raw_input.txt"
        Artifact {
            filePath: "processed_input.txt"
            fileTags: "processed_file"
        }
        prepare: {
            var cmd = new JavaScriptCommand();
            cmd.description = "Processing '" + input.filePath + "'";
            cmd.highlight = "codegen";
            cmd.sourceCode = function() {
                var file = new TextFile(input.filePath);
                var content = file.readAll();
                file.close()
                content = content.replace(/\r\n/g, "\n");
                file = new TextFile(output.filePath, TextFile.WriteOnly);
                file.truncate();
                file.write(content);
                file.close();
            }
            return cmd;
        }
    }
    \endcode
    This example exhibits some interesting features of transformers:
    \list
        \li If there is only one input file, the property \c input is available as syntactic sugar
            for \c inputs[0].
        \li The filenames of the output artifacts are available as \c outputs. If there is only one
            of these, it can be referred to it as \c output.
    \endlist

    A \c Transformer is always attached to a \c Product, possibly indirectly via a \c Module.
