    \title Product Item
    \brief Represents the result of a build process.

    A \e product typically represents the result of a build process. It specifies a set of
    input and output files and a way to transform the former into the latter. For example, the
    following product sets up a very simple C++ application:
    \code
    Product {
        name: "helloworld"
        type: "application"
        files: "main.cpp"
        Depends { name: "cpp" }
    }
    \endcode
    The \c type property specifies what will be built (an executable). The \c files property specifies
    the input files (one C++ source file), and the \c Depends item pulls in the logic from the \c cpp module
    about how to do the necessary transformations.
    For some often-used types of products, \QBS pre-defines special derived items that save
    users some typing. These are:
    \list
        \li Application
        \li CppApplication
        \li DynamicLibrary
        \li StaticLibrary
    \endlist
    Therefore, the above example could also be written like this:
    \code
    CppApplication {
        name: "helloworld"
        files: "main.cpp"
    }
    \endcode
    Any property \c prop attached to this item is available in sub-items as \c product.prop, as
    well as in modules that are loaded from this product.

    \table
        \header
            \li Property
            \li Type
            \li Default
            \li Description
        \row
            \li builtByDefault
            \li bool
            \li true
            \li If false, the product will only be built if this is explicitly requested,
                either by listing the product name as an argument to \c --products or by giving
                the \c build command the \c --all-products option.
        \row
            \li condition
            \li bool
            \li true
            \li If false, the product will not be built.
        \row
            \li name
            \li string
            \li empty string
            \li The name of the product. Used to identify the product in a \c Depends item, for
                example. The value of this property must be a simple JavaScript expression that
                does not depend on module properties or values that are non-local to this product.
                \code
                CppApplication {
                    name: "hello" + "world"                     // valid
                }
                CppApplication {
                    name: "app_for_" + qbs.targetOS.join("_")   // invalid
                }
                \endcode
                To change the name of your product's target artifact, modify \c{Product.targetName}
                instead.
        \row
            \li profiles
            \li stringList
            \li \c{[project.profile]}
            \li The profiles for which the product should be built. For each profile listed here,
                one instance of the product will be built according to the properties set in
                the respective profile.
                This property is only relevant for projects that require products being built for
                different architectures. Otherwise it can be left at its default value.
        \row
            \li type
            \li stringList
            \li empty list
            \li The file tags matching the product's target artifacts.
        \row
            \li targetName
            \li string
            \li \c{name} with illegal file name characters replaced by underscores
            \li The base file name of the product's target artifacts.
        \row
            \li destinationDirectory
            \li string
            \li product.buildDirectory
            \li The directory where the target artifacts will be located. If a relative path is
                given, the base directory will be \c project.buildDirectory.
        \row
            \li files
            \li stringList
            \li empty list
            \li A list of source files. Syntactic sugar to save a \c Group item for simple products.
        \row
            \li excludeFiles
            \li stringList
            \li empty list
            \li A list of source files not to include. Useful with wildcards.
                For more information, see \l {Group Item}.

        \row
            \li consoleApplication
            \li bool
            \li linker-dependent
            \li If true, a console application is generated. If false, a GUI application is generated.
                Only takes effect on Windows.
                This property also influences the default application type on OS X and iOS.
                If true, an application bundle is generated. If false, a normal executable is
                generated.
        \row
            \li qbsSearchPaths
            \li stringList
            \li project.qbsSearchPaths
            \li See the documentation of the \l {Project Item} property of the same name.
                The value set here will be merged with the one inherited from
                the project.
        \row
            \li version
            \li string
            \li undefined
            \li The version number of the product. Used in shared library filenames and generated
                Info.plist files in OS X and iOS application and framework bundles, for example.
    \endtable

    The following properties are automatically set by \QBS and cannot be changed by the user:

    \table
        \header
            \li Property
            \li Type
            \li Description
        \row
            \li buildDirectory
            \li path
            \li The build directory for this product. This is the directory where generated files
                are placed.
        \row
            \li profile
            \li string
            \li The profile for building this particular instance of the product. Derived
                automatically from the \c profiles property.
        \row
            \li sourceDirectory
            \li path
            \li The source directory for this product. This is the directory of the file where this
                product is defined.
    \endtable
