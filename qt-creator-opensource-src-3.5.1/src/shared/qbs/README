Build Instructions
==================
Prerequisites:
   * Qt 5.1.0 or later
   * On Windows:
     -  MinGW or Visual Studio

The installed toolchains have to match the one Qt was compiled with.

You can build qbs with

    cd $SOURCE_DIRECTORY
    qmake -r

Installation ("make install") is not needed. It is however possible, using
