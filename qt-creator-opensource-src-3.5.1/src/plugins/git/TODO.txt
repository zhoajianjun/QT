Commands:
 - P3:
        - allow to use external viewer instead of greenhouse one
          as these have more functionality usually

GUI:
 - Better diff view
 - Commit action View
        - Able to add further files to commit (list of modified/untracked files)
 - use List for Log (and allow 10+ entries)
Backend:
 - Don't use forked processes, instead find a library connection like libgit-thin
        - http://repo.or.cz/w/git/libgit-gsoc.git
 - apply to SCM Manager in Greenhouse, currently it's mostly independent

Suggestions:
 - Bjorn: Use a "Summary" Lineedit in the commit dialog to make commits look nicer on gitweb or such.
